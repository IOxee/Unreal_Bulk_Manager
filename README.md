## ‚öôÔ∏è Tailoring

Before deploying the script, ponder over its configurations:

- **Selectors**:
  - `PRICE_CLASS`: Pinpoints the asset's price tag.
  - `ASSET_CONTAINER_CLASS`: Identifies the main container of each asset.
  - `ADD_TO_CART_BUTTON_CLASS`: Locates the "Add to Cart" action button.
  - `REVIEW_BUTTON_CLASS`: Checks if an asset has a "Write a Review" button.
  - `ITEM_NAME_CLASS`: Retrieves the name of the asset.

> üìù Tip: These selectors come pre-configured. However, adaptability is key. Stay alert for any structural shifts in the Marketplace's web layout.

- **Operational Dynamics**:
  - `DELAY_BETWEEN_ACTIONS`: Spaces out actions to ensure site harmony.
  - `MAX_ITEMS`: Acts as a ceiling to the script's operations, safeguarding against over-activity.
